# Introduction
A script that converts commonly used Windows system shortcuts into MacOS ones. You only need to compile the mac.ahk file (or use the exe I uploaded) and set it to start up automatically when you turn on your computer.

This script is mainly designed to help people like me who have been using MacOS for a long time but sometimes have to use Windows system to deal with some problems.

# Current situation
Currently, commonly used shortcuts such as copy, paste, select all, and input method switching have been implemented. For specific details, please refer to the content of the mac.ahk file.
